	 * 23.1) it finds an elements smaller than the current one and places it at it's respective place
	 * 			and then shifts all of the others
	 * 23.2) it will swap 45... it will swap until there is no numbers to swap
	 * 
	 * 23.3) n
	 * 
	 * 23.4) it will swap the numbers with the number next to it until they are all sorted
	 * 
	 * 23.5) same
	 * 
	 * 23.6) n-1
	 * 
	 * 23.7) n logn, it devides the array until the array is n little arrays and then slowly rearranged them in order to be sorted
	 * 
	 * 23.8) array / 2, -> {45, 11, 50, 59} & {60, 2, 4 ,7 10} - > redivide alot, then reconstruct will sorting
	 * 
	 * 23.9) it will be an infinite loop yo.
	 * 
	 * 23.10) nlog n. It uses a pivot to divide the array in order to sort some smaller arrays
	 * 
	 * 23.11) it does not use a 3rd array to temporarely store the sorted array.
	 * 
	 * 23.12) the pivot will first be 45 (first element) and will swap some values in order to have only smaller and bigger values on the left and right, after it will divide and start again, then it will merge the small arrays and it will be sorted
	 * 
	 * 23.13) a complete binary tree is a binary tree that have every "legs" filled except the last one on the right ans 
	 * a heap is a complete binary tree but each leaf is smaller than its parent
	 * 
	 * 23.14) the root
	 * 
	 * 23.15) see agenda
	 * 
	 * 23.16) see agenda
	 * 
	 * 23.17) nlogn
	 * 
	 * 23.18)see agenda //SEE TEACHER
	 * 
	 * 23.19) it will be in reverse order
	 * 
	 * 23.20) 4 
	 * 
	 * 23.21) by alphabetic order to the first letter
	 * 
	 * 23.22) with the reminders,.
	 * 
	 * 23.23)n log n, it is like a merge sort, were it subdivides in smaller problems
	 * 
	 * 23.24) //SEE TEACHER
